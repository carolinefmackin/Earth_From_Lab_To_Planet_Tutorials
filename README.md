# Earth_From_Lab_to_Planet_Tutorials
This repository contains numerical tutorials - Jupyter Notebooks and MATLAB scripts - for the undergraduate course ***Earth From Lab to Planet*** (GEO 315L) 
instructed by Prof Thorsten Becker and Prof. Peter Flemings at the University of Texas at Austin.

Software development was led by Dunyu Liu with support from Thorsten Becker, partially based on exercises developed earlier in Matlab for

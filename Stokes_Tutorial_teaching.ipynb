    "This tutorial solves the *Stokes equation* numerically. The Stokes equation captures static force equilibrium for a laminar, low Reynolds number fluid. In this case, velocities and pressure within the fluid are entirely controlled by the density and viscosity distribution within the medium and the boundary conditions. The velocity solution is *instantaneous*, that is there is no time-dependence in the force balance (momentum conservation) part of the problem. For real problems, the flow that corresponds to the density anomaly will transport the density anomaly around, hence modifying the flow field over time, but this is only due to the transport, and at each instance, velocities are still in static equilibrium. In particular, there are no effects of inertia for sluggish, laminar flow. This flow regime holds for the mantle, and we will later add the diffusion and advvection of temperature (and hence density anomalies to the problem), leading to *convection*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on the Stokes flow solution part, exploring cases similar to your experiments. Under the hood (the StokesLib.py part) we use a finite element method to solve the equations. This finite element method relies on *discretizing* the medium into little chunks, elements, and the associated mesh will affect the solution. The finer, the better, in general, but also the longer it takes to solve the equation, and the more memory is needed. We start below with some default settings, but you can change the resolution.\n",
